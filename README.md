# -Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-based-on-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Forgery-Detectio
The proposed deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model trained using celebA dataset and the generator was capable of creating high-quality created fake human face images. And demonstrated GAN-generated image detection by applying five different ImageNet classification models to the job of categorizing real or fake images. The gathered data demonstrates that ImageNet provides a higher level of accuracy and that the produced images are of outstanding quality.
